/// What is AutoRoute?
///
/// Itâ€™s a Flutter navigation package,
/// it allows for strongly-typed arguments passing,
/// effortless deep-linking and it uses code generation to simplify routes setup,
/// with that being said it requires a minimal amount of code to generate everything needed for navigation inside of your App.

/// Check https://pub.dev/packages/auto_route for more details
